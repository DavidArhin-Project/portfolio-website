    <p>
        My name is David Arhin, and I am a computing student with a strong interest

    <h3>Educational Background</h3>
    <p>
        I am currently enrolled in a computing-related programme where
        I am gaining both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in
        areas such as web design, multimedia systems, and computer
        applications. Through my coursework, I have developed a solid
        foundation in HTML, CSS, and basic web development principles.
    </p>

    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    <p>
        My career goal is to become a skilled information technology
        professional with a specialization in web development and
        digital solutions. I aspire to continuously improve my technical
        skills and contribute to innovative projects that solve
        real-world problems.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
    <p>
        Beyond academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies, learning
        about modern web trends, and improving my problem-solving
        abilities. I am also interested in teamwork and collaborative
        learning, which I believe are essential in the technology field.
